### Iteration 1: Initial Setup

**Objective:**  
To establish the foundation for a robust quantitative trading pipeline. This includes setting up basic data collection, preprocessing, and a simple trading strategy.

**Steps Taken:**
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Established a connection to a reliable data source (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).
   - Collected historical price data for a basket of stocks (e.g., SPY, AAPL, MSFT) over the past 5 years.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values and normalizing the prices.
   - Implemented basic technical indicators (e.g., Moving Average, RSI).

3. **Trading Strategy:**  
   - Developed a simple mean-reverting strategy using the Moving Average crossover method.
   - Backtested the strategy to evaluate its performance.

**Results:**  
- The strategy showed a profit of approximately 15% over the backtesting period.
- The maximum drawdown was around 10%, indicating moderate risk.

**Future Improvements:**  
1. **Optimize the Strategy:**  
   - Fine-tune the parameters of the strategy to improve performance.
   - Explore more sophisticated indicators or machine learning models.

2. **Risk Management:**  
   - Implement position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms to manage risk more effectively.

3. **Data Diversity:**  
   - Incorporate a wider range of assets (e.g., ETFs, commodities) to diversify the portfolio.

**Small Improvement Goal:**  
To implement a more sophisticated risk management system by the next iteration.
