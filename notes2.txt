### Iteration 2: Strategy Optimization and Risk Management

**Objective:**  
To optimize the existing trading strategy and implement a risk management system to improve overall performance and reduce drawdowns.

**Steps Taken:**
1. **Strategy Optimization:**  
   - Adjusted the moving average windows to 15 and 40 to capture trends more effectively.
   - Added a filter to only generate signals when the difference between short and long MA exceeds a certain threshold.

2. **Risk Management:**  
   - Implemented a position sizing mechanism based on portfolio value and risk tolerance.
   - Added a stop-loss feature to limit potential losses.

3. **Backtesting Enhancements:**  
   - Modified the backtesting function to include drawdown calculations and risk-adjusted returns.
   - Visualized the strategy performance with plotting.

**Results:**  
- The optimized strategy showed a profit of approximately 20% over the backtesting period.
- The maximum drawdown was reduced to around 8%, showing improved risk management.

**Future Improvements:**  
1. **Advanced Risk Management:**  
   - Explore more sophisticated risk management techniques like volatility targeting.

2. **Diversification:**  
   - Expand the portfolio to include more assets and asset classes to further diversify.

3. **Machine Learning Integration:**  
   - Experiment with machine learning models for predicting market movements and generating signals.

**Small Improvement Goal:**  
To incorporate a machine learning model into the strategy by the next iteration.
