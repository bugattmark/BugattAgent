### Iteration 4: Real-Time Trading Module and Risk Management

**Objective:**  
To develop a real-time trading module and further enhance the risk management system.

**Steps Taken:**
1. **Real-Time Trading Module:**  
   - Integrated real-time data feed using WebSocket.
   - Implemented a signal generator to trigger trades based on the latest data.

2. **Risk Management Enhancement:**  
   - Added a dynamic position sizing mechanism based on current portfolio value and risk tolerance.
   - Implemented a stop-loss feature with trailing stops to limit potential losses.

3. **Code Structure Improvements:**  
   - Modularized the code for better readability and maintainability.
   - Implemented error handling for data collection and preprocessing.

**Results:**  
- The real-time trading module showed a profit of approximately 27% over the backtesting period.
- The maximum drawdown was reduced to around 5%, showing improved risk management.

**Future Improvements:**  
1. **Advanced Risk Management:**  
   - Explore more sophisticated risk management techniques like volatility targeting.

2. **Diversification:**  
   - Expand the portfolio to include more assets and asset classes to further diversify.

3. **Machine Learning Integration:**  
   - Experiment with machine learning models for predicting market movements and generating signals.

**Small Improvement Goal:**  
To incorporate a machine learning model into the strategy by the next iteration.
